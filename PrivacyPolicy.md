# WalkWays Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 12/11/2024

At WalkWays, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our app. By using the WalkWays app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
### 1. Information We Collect

- **Personal Information:** When you sign up or log in, we collect personal information such as your name and email address through Firebase Authentication. This information is used solely for account creation and user authentication.
- **Location Data:** We collect location data to provide you with route directions and track your progress during walks. However, we do not store your location data after the session ends. We only use location data temporarily for route tracking and providing directions.
- **Media Uploads:** If you choose to upload photos or other media (e.g., for feedback), these files are stored securely in Firebase Storage. Only you have access to your uploaded content.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

- We use your personal data (such as your name and email) for authentication, user identification, and communication related to your account and app activities.
- Your location data is used temporarily to provide directions and track your route while walking. We do not retain location data beyond the walk session.
- We use anonymized route data (including GPS coordinates) to improve the app's features, such as enhancing route recommendations. This data is stored without personal identifiers, ensuring that you remain anonymous.

### 3. Data Sharing and Security

- We do not share your personal data with third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal processes.
- All data exchanged between your device and our servers is encrypted using SSL encryption to protect it from unauthorized access.
- We have implemented strict Firebase Firestore rules to ensure that your data is only accessible to you. Your personal information (e.g., name, email) is stored securely and is only accessible by you.

### 4. Data Control and Deletion

- You have the ability to delete your walking history at any time from the app, which will remove any association between your personal data and the walking data. The anonymized data will remain in the system for analytics purposes but will no longer be linked to your account.
- You can also delete your account at any time by contacting us through the app's support section.

### 5. User Consent

- By using WalkWays, you consent to the collection of your personal information, location data, and media uploads as described in this Privacy Policy. You have the right to withdraw consent at any time by deleting your account or opting out of location tracking.

### 6. Changes to the Privacy Policy

- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will notify users through the app and update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
